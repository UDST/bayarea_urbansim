# This is really simple and basic (hackish) code to solve a very important
# problem.  I'm calling an orca step and want to serialize the tables that
# are passed in so that I can add code to this orca step and test it quickly
# without running all the models that came before, which takes many minutes.
#
# If the passed in outhdf does not exist, all the DataFarmeWrappers which
# have been passed have their DataFrames saved to the hdf5.  If the file
# does exist they all get restored, and as a byproduct their types are
# changed from DataFrameWrappers to DataFrames.  This type change is a
# major drawback of the current code, as is the fact that other non-
# DataFrame types are not serialized, but it's a start.  I plan to bring
# this problem up on the UrbanSim coders call the next time we meet.
#
#    Sample code:
#
#    d = save_and_restore_state(locals())
#    for k in d.keys():
#        locals()[k].local = d[k]
#

        for table_name in store:
            print("Restoring", table_name)
            out_d[table_name[1:]] = store[table_name]
        return out_d

    # the state doesn't exist and thus needs to be saved
    store = pd.HDFStore(outhdf, "w")
