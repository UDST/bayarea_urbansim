        receiving_buildings_filter - filter for eligible buildings
    settings : Dict
        The overall settings
    account : Account
        The Account object to use for subsidization
    year : int
        The current simulation year (will be added as metadata)
    form_to_btype_func : function
        Passed through to run_developer
    add_extra_columns_func : function
        Passed through to run_developer
    summary : Summary
        Used to add parcel summary information
    create_deed_restricted : bool
        Bool for whether to create deed restricted units with the subsidies
        or not.  The logic at the time of this writing is to keep track of
        partial units so that when partial units sum to greater than a unit,
        that unit will be deed restricted.

    Returns
    -------
    Nothing

    Subsidized residential developer is designed to run before the normal
    residential developer - it will prioritize the developments we're
    subsidizing (although this is not strictly required - running this model
    after the market rate developer will just create a temporarily larger
    supply of units, which will probably create less market rate development in
    the next simulated year)
    the steps for subsidizing are essentially these

    1 run feasibility with only_built set to false so that the feasibility of
        unprofitable units are recorded
    2 temporarily filter to ONLY unprofitable units to check for possible
        subsidized units (normal developer takes care of market-rate units)
    3 compute the number of units in these developments
    4 divide cost by number of units in order to get the subsidy per unit
    5 filter developments to parcels in "receiving zone" similar to the way we
        identified "sending zones"
    6 iterate through subaccounts one at a time as subsidy will be limited
        to available funds in the subaccount (usually by jurisdiction)
    7 sort ascending by subsidy per unit so that we minimize subsidy (but total
        subsidy is equivalent to total building cost)
    8 cumsum the total subsidy in the buildings and locate the development
        where the subsidy is less than or equal to the amount in the account -
        filter to only those buildings (these will likely be built)
    9 pass the results as "feasible" to run_developer - this is sort of a
        boundary case of developer but should run OK
    10 for those developments that get built, make sure to subtract from
        account and keep a record (on the off chance that demand is less than
        the subsidized units, run through the standard code path, although it's
        very unlikely that there would be more subsidized housing than demand)
