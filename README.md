bayarea_urbansim
=======

This is the full UrbanSim implementation for the Bay Area.

BEWARE: THE CURRENT MASTER REQUIRES THE bayarea_v3.h5 FILE.

###How To
The ipython notebooks in /notebooks are the easiest way to start. 

The *estimation* notebook allows the estimation of price models and location choices, the *simulation* notebook runs the full UrbanSim simulation, and the *exploration* notebook allows the interactive exploration of the included data using web mapping tools (primarily enabling the interaction between Leaflet and Pandas).

###Data
Read `spandex-install.pdf` for information on how to regenerate data for much of the data (except zoning) necessary in the /data folder.
